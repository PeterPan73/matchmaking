Here are some notes of things I wanted to fix but ran out of time:


client.js:
  -I believe the Client class is working, but it's not tested beyond me manually instantiating / calling its functions.
  -I had just been using curl commands as a "client", and running them from my command line
    For instance, to test two players connecting / matchmaking I would make the first player's
    start request followed by the second players start request and then run the polling requests etc.
  -The error handling in the request retry method I think is wrong. I ran out of time to test properly.
